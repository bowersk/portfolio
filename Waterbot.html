		            <p> After getting my master’s degree in mechatronics I decided I needed to put my newly acquired skills to the test before jumping into the working world. I've always been fascinated by plants (having spent lots of time in my Japanese grandfather's garden) so after watching countless episodes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/growingyourgreens">John Kohler's phenomenal youtube channel</a> I decided that it was time to start growing my own greens! Because of space limitations and that fact that I will most likely move around a lot in the bay area, I decided to grow indoors under lights and use the traditional soil growing method instead of hydroponics. Waterbot is what I have come up with. <br><br>

		            This robot of mine is a remote controlled 600mL water tank with a 2 axis SCARA arm attached to it that dispenses water from the tip of the arm. It rides along an OpenBuilds V-slot extrusion and refuels it's onboard tank via a refueling station which inserts a nozzle into the Waterbot's tank and pumps water (or compost tea!) to top off the robot. Because Waterbot uses a <a href="http://www.vegetronix.com/Products/VH400/">Vegetronix VH400 moisture sensor</a>, it knows when to shut the refueling pump off an not flood my bedroom. This sensor is also used to know how much water each plant is receiving. As of now I am controlling the robot with a PlayStation 3 controller which communicates with the Raspberry Pi onboard Waterbot via Bluetooth, but I am working on writing software to use computer vision and autonomously water all of my plants. <br><br>

		            I believe that the best food for humans are vegetables and fruits, and with the help of robotics we can build systems that are beneficial to the health of us, the earth, plants, and all of the microbes in the soil. This project has been an amazing educational journey which has forced me to dive deep into where the food that I put into my mouth comes from and I have been so shocked by how much fossil fuel is used just to get that perfect head of lettuce to the grocery store. (Oil is as the root of the fertilizer, the herbicides, the pesticides, the farm equipment, the transportation, and on and on) I want to bring my plants to their full genetic potential and I want to do it by taking care of them with solar energy to power my robots and lights. This has been a truly life changing project and within a year I want to ramp up production in order harvest a giant salad every day. And let me tell you, when you baby your soil with rock dust, compost tea, and beneficial microbes, and eat your plants the second you pick them the taste will blow your mind! </p>
